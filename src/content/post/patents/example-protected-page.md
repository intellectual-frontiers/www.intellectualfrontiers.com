### Abstract

A computer-controlled system for digitally evaluating one or more computer-executable and traceable metrics associated with a machine at a node. The system includes a computerized data collection wireless device for collecting digital data stored in the form of a plurality of computer-executable files from the machine. The computerized data collection wireless device includes a metric logistics device that generates a metric queue containing a plurality of computer-executable metric components storing information indicative of at least one of a date, time, geo-coordinates, machine identification details, and computer readable and executable performance data associated with the machine. The system includes a data aggregator and a computer-controlled metric appliance communicatively coupled to the data aggregator and receives the metric queue from the data aggregator. The computer-controlled metric appliance analyzes and processes the metric queue to generate an output that is indicative of whether the metric is achieved or not by the machine.

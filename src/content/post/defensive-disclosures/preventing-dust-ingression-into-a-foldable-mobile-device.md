## Abstract

This publication describes techniques and apparatuses directed to the prevention of dust
ingression into a foldable mobile device (e.g., at a hinge module). The techniques and apparatuses
include a flexible seal portion that has an elastic portion configured to conform to the teardrop
shape of an inner display and a fabric portion configured to fill a gap between the display and the
enclosure(s) of the foldable mobile device.

display, enclosure, gap, ingress, ingression, rubber, fabric, damage

## Background

Electronic devices (e.g., smartphones, foldable mobile devices) are typically sealed against
ingression by contaminants (e.g., dust, water). For example, a device may include a housing
enclosure having two portions that are tightly fitted together with seals to prevent dust and water
ingress into the circuitry and other components housed within the enclosure. These contaminants
can cause damage to the device and/or its components, for example, dust within an electronic
device may cause one or more of short circuits, physical damage (e.g., delamination, cracks),
obstruction of moving parts (e.g., functional degradation of the components of a hinge module),
heat build-up, and other damage.

While a variety of seals, gaskets, adhesives, and mechanical fastening means may be
utilized to mitigate dust ingression in electronic devices, foldable mobile devices have unique dust
ingress challenges. This is because the flexible display of the device may need to be, in part,
movably attached to the housing to permit the bending of the flexible display at the hinge module
of the device. This movable attachment can make it difficult to form a seal. As a result, in a
foldable device, a gap may exist between the display and one or both of the sides of the enclosures
(e.g., at or adjacently to the hinge module), to which traditional apparatuses and methods utilized
for sealing electronic devices are ill-suited.

## Description

The problem of dust ingression into foldable mobile devices (e.g., at a hinge module) is
solved by applying a flexible seal portion to seal the gap between the display and the housing
enclosures of the device. Techniques and apparatuses directed to this solution are described in this
publication.

FIG. 1 illustrates the inside and outside of a flexible seal portion 100 before it is applied to
a housing enclosure(s) of a foldable mobile device. The flexible seal portion 100 includes an
elastic portion 102 formed of an elastic material (e.g., a rubber sheet). Examples of suitable elastic
materials include elastomers (e.g., natural rubber, synthetic rubber, and the like). The elastic
material may be composited with a polymer (e.g., polyethylene terephthalate (PET)).
At least one strip of a pressure-sensitive adhesive (PSA) (e.g., strip 104, strip 106) or other
adhesive material is applied to the outside of the flexible seal portion 100. The adhesive material
is configured to adhere to the housing enclosure(s) to connect the flexible seal portion 100 to the
housing enclosure(s) to seal a gap between a foldable display panel (illustrated in FIG. 3 as display
panel 302 of foldable mobile device 300) and an enclosure (illustrated in FIG. 2 as housing
enclosure 220 and housing enclosure 230) to prevent the ingress of contaminants (e.g., dust
particles) into the housing and/or components of the foldable mobile device. The adhesive material
may include double-sided tape (DST).
The flexible seal portion 100 includes at least one fabric portion (e.g., fabric portion 108,
fabric portion 110) that is configured to fill a gap. The fabric portion may be configured to deform.
In some aspects, the fabric portion (e.g., a fabric sheet) is a woven fabric or other woven material.
In other aspects, the fabric portion is a non-woven fabric. The fabric portion may include a mesh
formed of a polymer base material (e.g., polyester (PES), polyamide (PA), polypropylene (PP),
and the like). Examples of suitable mesh include SATTIÂ® mesh, sound-permeable membranes,
air-permeable membranes, acoustic mesh, hydrophobic seals, and the like. The fabric portion may
be adhered to the elastic portion, integrally formed with the elastic portion, and the like.

FIG. 2 illustrates the foldable mobile device with a first housing enclosure 220 and a second
housing enclosure 230. The first housing enclosure 220 includes a first hinge support plate 222
and the second housing enclosure 230 includes a second hinge support plate 232. At least one
hinge module 240 (e.g., hinge assembly) hingedly connects the first hinge support plate 222 to the
second hinge support plate 232. The first housing enclosure 220 and the second housing enclosure
230 define a recess that is configured for receiving a foldable display panel (illustrated in FIG. 3
as display panel 302). In this view, the inside of the flexible seal portion 100 is visible, with the
outside of the flexible seal portion 100 facing the hinge module 240 of the foldable mobile device.

FIG. 3 illustrates the foldable mobile device 300 with the display panel 302 received within
the recesses defined in the first housing enclosure 220 and the second housing enclosure 230, with
the position of the flexible seal portion 100 illustrated in dashed-line fashion. To prevent the
ingress of dust and other contaminants (e.g., through the hinge module) into housing and/or
components of the foldable mobile device, the flexible seal portion 100 is adhered, via the PSA
(e.g., strip 104, strip 106) to the enclosure(s) (e.g., first housing enclosure 220, second housing
enclosure 230). For example, by adhering the first strip 104 of the PSA to the first hinge support
plate 222 of the first housing enclosure 220 and the second strip 106 of the PSA to the second hinge support plate 232 of the second housing enclosure 230, as illustrated in FIG. 3. In FIG. 3,
the foldable mobile device 300 is illustrated in an open position.

FIG. 4 illustrates the foldable mobile device 300 in a closed (folded) position. In the aspect
illustrated in FIG. 4, the elastic portion 102 of the flexible seal portion 100 is configured to conform
to the teardrop shape of an inner display panel (e.g., display panel 302) to seal gaps between the
display panel 302 and the housing enclosures (e.g., housing enclosure 220, housing enclosure 230)
and prevent the ingress of dust and other contaminants into the housing and/or components of the
foldable mobile device 300. For example, by sealing gaps (e.g., gap 402, gap 404) between the
display panel 302 and the housing enclosures of the foldable mobile device 300 at the hinge module 240. By so doing, the techniques may reduce short circuits, physical damage (e.g., delamination,
cracks), obstruction of moving parts (e.g., components of a hinge module of a foldable mobile
device), heat build-up, and other damage in foldable mobile devices.

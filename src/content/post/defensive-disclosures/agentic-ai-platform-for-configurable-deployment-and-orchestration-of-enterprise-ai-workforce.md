## Abstract

An embodiment herein provides an agentic AI-based enterprise platform that enables autonomous task execution across distributed enterprise systems using modular AI agents. The platform comprises a layered system architecture including an autonomous agent layer, task orchestration module, model selection engine, integration interfaces, logging infrastructure, and a workflow execution controller. Each AI agent operates as a stateless container with internal subsystems for task execution, contextual memory, AI model invocation, and output normalization. Workflows may be defined as directed acyclic graphs and dynamically instantiated by the task orchestration module based on enterprise-defined templates. In embodiments, the platform supports deployment in compliance-sensitive domains and enables scalable hybrid AI-human task execution strategies.

## Background

**_Technical Field_**

[0001] The embodiments described herein relate generally to artificial intelligence (AI) systems and, more particularly, to a configurable service platform for orchestrating autonomous AI agents for enterprise workflow automation.

**_Description of the Related Art_**

[0002] In recent years, enterprises have increasingly turned to automation tools and intelligent systems to manage complex and high-volume business operations. Traditional approaches to business process automation have relied on rule-based engines, robotic process automation (RPA), or hardcoded logic, often leading to brittle systems that require extensive manual configuration and intervention. While cloud-based platforms and large language models (LLMs) have emerged to augment productivity, they are generally limited to single-turn tasks or static prompts, and lack orchestration capabilities across domains.
[0003] Furthermore, existing solutions are often not equipped to support dynamic coordination between independently executing agents, nor do they incorporate robust mechanisms for real-time context propagation, adaptive model selection, or compliance-centric auditability. There exists a need for a unified, modular system that can instantiate, manage, and coordinate behavior of the AI agents across a diverse array of enterprise tasks while supporting interoperability, fault-tolerance, and human oversight.

## Summary

[0004] The embodiments herein provide a modular and scalable agentic AI-based platform configured for autonomous execution of enterprise workflows. The platform includes an autonomous agent layer comprising a plurality of stateless software agents, each provisioned with an internal architecture including a task execution engine, in-memory contextual state manager, AI model invocation interface, and input-output normalization module.

[0005] A task orchestration module is configured to retrieve machine-readable workflow templates, instantiate agents per task node, and manage task state transitions through a finite state machine. The platform may further comprise a model selection engine that dynamically chooses AI models from a model repository based on semantic classification, resource constraints, and performance criteria. The model repository maintains versioned references to general-purpose, multimodal, or domain-specific AI models with failover capabilities.

[0006] The platform includes an integration layer supporting bidirectional data exchange with external enterprise systems via standardized protocols, and an API gateway interface for workflow ingress and multi-tenant security. A logging and traceability module captures runtime telemetry and error events, while a workflow execution controller manages agent health, task reallocation, and execution policy compliance.

[0007] In some embodiments, the platform incorporates domain-specific agent templates and protocol-based interoperability layers such as agent-to-agent (A2A) communication frameworks. These facilitate dynamic agent collaboration across vendor boundaries and distributed computing environments.

[0008] Additional embodiments describe runtime checkpoints, human-in-the-loop controls, and compliance-focused safeguards such as traceable decision logs, contextual fallback strategies, and execution policy enforcement. The disclosed system thereby enables cognitive enterprise transformation by extending human capabilities through orchestrated AI agents in a modular, auditable, and resilient infrastructure.

## Detailed Description

[0016] The embodiments herein and the various features and advantageous details thereof are explained more fully with reference to the non-limiting embodiments that are illustrated in the accompanying drawings and detailed in the following description.  Descriptions of well-known components are omitted so as to not unnecessarily obscure the embodiments herein.  The examples used herein are intended merely to facilitate an understanding of ways in which the embodiments herein may be practiced and to further enable those of skill in the art to practice the embodiments herein.  Accordingly, the examples should not be construed as limiting the scope of the embodiments herein.

[0017] In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration specific embodiments in which the embodiments herein may be practiced.  These embodiments, which are also referred to herein as “examples,” are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the embodiments herein, and it is to be understood that the embodiments may be combined, or that other embodiments may be utilized and that structural, logical, and electrical changes may be made without departing from the scope of the embodiments herein.

[0018] Referring now to FIGS 1 and 2, there is illustrated a system architecture of an agentic AI-based service platform 100 configured for autonomous enterprise workflow execution across multiple domains. The platform 100 comprises a plurality of integrated components including an autonomous agent layer 102, a task orchestration module 104, a model selection engine 106, a model repository 108, a workflow configuration database 110, an enterprise integration layer 112, an API gateway interface 114, a logging and traceability module 116, and a workflow execution controller 118. The components are operatively interconnected to facilitate decomposition, allocation, execution, and monitoring of domain-specific tasks without requiring human intervention.

[0019] The autonomous agent layer 102 is comprised of a set of software-defined agents such as 120a and 120b, each implemented as an independent runtime container or process. In embodiments, illustrated in the FIGS. 1 and 2, only two such agents are shown, however, there can be more than two or only one agent in the autonomous agent layer 102. Each agent 120a and 120b is provisioned with a local task execution engine 302, an in-memory contextual state manager 304, a model invocation interface 306, and an input-output normalization sub-module 308. These sub-components are shown and further discussed in conjunction with FIG. 3. The agents collectively referred to as agents 120 are stateless between workflow instances but preserve a transient execution context during runtime. Each agent 120 receives an input in a structured data format comprising a task identifier, input type, payload content, and metadata. The agent 120 processes the input by invoking one or more AI models 122 via the model interface 124 and returns an output payload, which includes result codes, action results, and routing references for subsequent task nodes. In failure scenarios, the agents 120 are configured with a fallback policy for either re-attempting execution using alternative models or escalating to a predefined handler.
